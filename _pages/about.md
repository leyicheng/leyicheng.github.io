<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I’m Leyi Cheng (“程乐怡” in Chinese), currently a senior student at the [School of Computer Science and Technology, Soochow University](https://scst.suda.edu.cn/).  I am conducting research in the [Advanced Data Analytics (ADA) Laboratory](https://ada.suda.edu.cn/), supervised by Professor [Xiaofang Zhang](https://web.suda.edu.cn/xfzhang/). Upon graduation, I will pursue a PhD under the supervision of Associate Professor [Zhen Dong](https://zhendong2050.github.io/) at the [CodeWisdom Laboratory](http://www.se.fudan.edu.cn/index.html), [College of Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence, Fudan University](https://cs.fudan.edu.cn/).

My research interests lie in **AI for Software Engineering (AI4SE)**, with a focus on applying intelligent methods to improve software quality and reliability. During my undergraduate studies, I worked on **software vulnerability detection**, exploring the integration of program analysis and machine learning. I am now extending this line of research toward data-driven and trustworthy AI techniques for automating and enhancing software engineering processes.
